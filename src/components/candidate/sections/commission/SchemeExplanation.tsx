        Our unique "You're Hired" bonus scheme allows you to earn a bonus when you're successfully placed in a role. Here's how it works:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Some employers offer a bonus of between 2.5% and 14% of your basic salary
        </li>
        <li>
          The bonus is typically split between you (the successful candidate) and anyone who referred you to the position
        </li>
        <li>
          You'll be able to see the exact bonus amount and split on job listings that offer this incentive
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
